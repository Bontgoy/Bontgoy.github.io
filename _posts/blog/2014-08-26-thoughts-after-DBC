It has been 3 weeks since I graduated from the Dev Bootcamp program in Chicago and I am starting to come down from the structure.  I have been so used to such an accelerated pace of existing that I am just now beginning to process the experience.  I trying take in for what I feel it has done for me and what I felt it was meant to do.  As of now I can say that change did occur at Dev Bootcamp.  I feel more comfortable in a developer's space and I know that I can learn the the things they teach.  I am trying to view software work as a trade that can be fine tuned and developed.  These things I expected DBC to deliver and I can say that they have done that.  The process was very challenging but I feel a sense of accomplishment for doing so.  As of right now I am in the process of interviewing with a few companies.  Who knows what will happen next. I will keep me posted.

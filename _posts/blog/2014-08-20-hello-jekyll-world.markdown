I might not a have a lot to say right away but I am trying.  When I thought about starting a blog, I was not fully prepared for the mental stamina it would take to create thought from scratch and put it to the page.  I tend be a veering individual when it comes using my spare time to focus.  However, these days, spare time is a different concept to me.  Writing conscious thought down on a site I created should be comforting.  

I\'m trying to develope a routine; a routine of learning and reflection.  I have always been a mover.  I have trouble sitting still.  I am desperate to focus and I think I can do it if I try.  This is my first serious post and I will be leaving it up.  I pledge to write something daily until this routine becomes a habit.  I am also going to get much better at engineering software.  Everyday I will be doing my best to become better at something.

Today I\'ll working on a bit of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) framework and will be revisiting some old exercises from [DBC](http://www.devbootcamp.com). If I have time tonight, I will post again to reflect on what I have learned\...

Everything does not have to be directly profound if it is honest.

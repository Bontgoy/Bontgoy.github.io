I get it, I get it, I finally get it. A moment of lucidity approaches as I refactor legacy code written by a high paid individual at a fortune 500. 

The demand for software developers comes from a lack of understanding of what the job really takes. 

Yes, there are tricky and unfamiliar things to learn and I am no where near my apex of competency in meta programming.

Late start noobs like me get a shot because their is clearly a lack of pride and autonomy in completing tasks.

It took reorganizing, rewriting, and redesigning a 30,000 character hard coded function to finally get it.

One day when I am somebody's boss I will have little interest in how you dress, where you wish to work from, and who your friends are.
You will come with respect and courtesy for your team and giving all of the shits. All of them...

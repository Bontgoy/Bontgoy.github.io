This letter was written to Zed A Shaw in response to his post [The Coming Code Bootcamp Destruction](http://zedshaw.com/2014/10/19/the-coming-code-bootcamp-destruction/).  I fixed some grammar by adding a few words like "that" and "is" that I left out in the throws of passion for improved readabilty.

Hi zedshaw,

I hope you have been getting a flood of emails and feedback for your upcoming posts about bootcamp destruction.  Im excited to read what you have to say.  I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp Chicago.  I would love to tell you my story.  

I am going to to try and bear the best of me so that you can understand why the worst of me chose to attend Dev Bootcamp.  I work hard.  I work really hard.  I put myself through college working two jobs and spending weekends volunteering at a local non-profit.  My political science degree was a fucking stupid choice based on my aptitude but a great choice based on my need to multitask.  I often appear as a student who comes in at the middle and finishes just above the bottom.  At least in my mind I do.  I passed college without finishing a single text book; literally.  That is not a point of pride.  When I can focus things go really well but I need a thing to do with both hands or I find myself day dreaming about white noise.

After college I spent about a year job hunting while paying my bills as a waiter and cook.  Along the way the glamor of volunteer letter writing for campaigns lost its luster.  As a 12 year restaurant industry vet I decided that I should save up and go to culinary school.  During that time I spent 80 hours a week working in restaurants fully immersing my mind and body into the trade.  I began coming up with ideas to improve the imaginary restaurant I would undoubtedly own and operate.  Most of my unique solutions where ones that involved usage and placement of Point of Sales systems.  I have ideas to improve an industry I have deep experience in and at the time had no means to produce a result.  For word space sake this part of the story leads me to taking my culinary school savings and investing in Dev Bootcamp.

I struggled along the way.  I pulled knowledge from both Learn Ruby the Hard Way and Learn Coding the Hard way.  I also read Learn to Program by Chris Pine and Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz.  I read those books cover to cover; something I have never done before.  I drew from The Well-Grounded Rubyist, The RSPEC Book, and Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design.  I read Learn to Count and am working through The Big Nerd Ranch: Objective C Programming book.  I finished DBC Chicago three months ago and I have been diligently job hunting this entire time.  I have not found work and I am not afraid.  I hope I do not come across as someone who just jumps into a snake oil project because of a shiny carrot.  I didn't leave a career because I hated it or wanted to make more money.  I want to contribute where I know I can contribute.  I was going to drop 70K on cooking school to likely make 12 dollars an hour for the first 3 years and after that barely 40K a year.  I have thought out my path and I will suffer properly until I get where I need to be on my own terms.

I am not alone.  My lived experiences may be unique but the types of folks I have met at DBC often hold a very deliberate reason to attend and it has less to do with pie eyed dreams of living the easy life.  I love that you want to hold organizations accountable for their methods and misconduct.  I feel very strongly about integrity.  My letter to you is to give you an honest account of a very particular demographic of individuals that take their choices very seriously.  Things that I did and learned at Dev Bootcamp were what I needed in order to get me to where I am now which is jobless and skilled enough to take one more step forward in the mud.  I did my research and at no point came into the program with any misconceptions; and in turn, it provided what I expected and more.  I made friends that are likeminded and unflappable.  Please give feedback that is Actionable, Specific, and Kind.  Ill be fine either way.

Sincerely

Tyler Keating

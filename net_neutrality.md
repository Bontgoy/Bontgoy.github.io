title: Net Neutrality Policy Landscape
permalink: /open-internet/
---

This is an attempt at delivering a concise explanation to a very complicated policy landscape.  I have written on and studied Net Neutrality, on a policy level, since 2010 and will happily answer any questions with as little bias as possible.  Regardless of alignment, Net Neutrality is very important and complex.  The nature of both the policy and how it is being presented publicly has a lot to do with why such an important issue is largely misunderstood or overlooked.  Please email (via footer links) if you would like me to clarify or provide more in-depth information.  

What is Net Neutrality?
======

Net Neutrality is the term coined for the debate between public and private sector policy players in regards to the how broadband providers are allowed to control and distribute our nation's internet connections. More specifically, the government organization, the FCC, is trying to decide what type of policy they should have in regards to these distributions.  As of now, the government has no Constitutional permissions to make any choices in regards to broadband commercial distributions.

If the FCC decides to keep the hands off policy...
======

Without government regulation network providers can decide how they choose the pricing for network distributions.  More importantly providers can regulate the speed of connections for both the user and the content available on the web.  

Why this should be thought about
----

* Often only a single distribution company occupies an entire region.  This is a monopoly. The government has laws in place to protect price gouging from other natural monopolies like power companies.

* Companies like Comcast/NBCU are a conglomerate of both a major network distributions company and a major content provider. This means the same company making money distributing internet connections also has a personal financial stake in content that can be viewed.

* Currently, network providers are trying to impose tiered service offerings for content.  This means a web-based company could pay additional fees to make their content show up faster and in more searches.  

* There is no indication that providing faster speeds and tiered services, for content, is a matter of resource management.  This means that companies paying for a faster service will actually be paying not to be slowed down.

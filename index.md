Just another human trying to muddle out some truth.  I enjoy understanding, building, and asking why.  I was born and raised in Montana now I live in Chicago.  I am spending my days learning to work with software, teaching folks how to dive into code for the first time, and trying to build lasting relationships with people and communities.  

My education in building software applications began when I had some thoughts on how to improve labor management within a kitchen.  I was training to become a chef and know the service industry world inside and out.  It was not long until I decided to make the shift into pursuing development as a full-time vocation.

I finished the [Dev Bootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com) program in Chicago in 2014 and have been working in the industry ever since.  Along with hacking in the terminal and setting up web apps, I have a previous of life experience in sales and production. I also have a BA in Policy Analysis from Montana State University.  I like people, cats, other anminals, pizza, and computer jobs.

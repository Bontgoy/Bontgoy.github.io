Just another human trying muddle out some truth.  I enjoy understanding, building, and asking why.  I was born and raised in Montana and recently uprooted myself.  Now, I am spending my days learning to work with software and trying building lasting relationships with people and communities.  

My education in building software applications began when I had some thoughts on how to improve labor management within a kitchen.  I was training to become an assistant chef and know the service industry world inside and out.  It was not long until I decided to make the shift into pursuing development as a full-time vocation.

I recently finished the [Dev Bootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com) program in Chicago and am seeking mentorship and employment to keep learning.  Along with my sales and production skills, I also have a BA in Policy Analysis from Montana State University.  I hope to prove myself as a unique and hard-working asset to anyone with the empathy to help me get wet behind the ears.
